My oxygen did not contain the necessary software packaging for me to create html file and so I had to go to help tab, then install new software, then I typed in this link - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen - Select web xml, then next and agree to the license, then you will be good to go.

Go to the website - start.spring.io to create a spring boot project and save the file to your pc, it will be saved as a jar file; you will have to extract it. Go to your java project, in my case – eclipse.  Afterwards, go to file, import, general, projects from folder or archive – then next, directory, computer and attain the saved spring boot file.

To create your first html page - Right click on static, create an html file and call it index because the home page has to be call index.
